# CISVisual
CISVisual was a visual novel information and ratings site that existed from 2006-2008. It was written in PHP 5.2 and used version 1 of the Zend Framework (now Laminas).

There is nothing novel about the code or the website, the source is shown here only because it was my first major personal project and it started the ball rolling
towards my professional career. For a full history on the site you can find more details on my [personal wiki](https://allthings.3decibels.net/wiki/TheInternet/CISVisual).
